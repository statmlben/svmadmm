Description: 
    Solve large-scale regularised linear/kernel classification by using ADMM and IADMM algorithms. This package provides linear L2-regularised primal classification (both ADMM and IADMM are available), kernel L2-regularised dual classification (IADMM) as well as L1-regularised primal classification (both ADMM and IADMM are available).
